## Purpose of this repository

This repository was for personal educational use. It was created following Samer Buna's React: Getting Started tutorials. I made personal changes to his code, including styling and folder structure. His tutorial can be found on [pluralsight.com](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) and at his educational website [jscomplete.com](https://jscomplete.com/learn).
